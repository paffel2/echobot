# echobot

This repository contains a echo bot for Telegram and VKontakte. The bot sends messages from the user to him in response. The project was created as a test task of the Metalamp company.

    # install compiler
      stack setup

        bot {
            type = "VKBot"/"TelegramBot"
            token = "token"

            }
        logger {
            priority = "Debug"/"Info"/"Warning"/"Error"
               }


To the run bot use
